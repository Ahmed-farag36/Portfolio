# My Portfolio Steps

## 1- Create the basic skeleton for (Landing, tech stack, contact) sections: ==> DONE

    - just placeholder for 3 main pages ✅
    - no icons  ✅
    - no styling  ✅
    - simple routing (react-router)  ✅

## 2- Create the portfolio section

    - Implement the back-end part (according to the blue playbook)  ✅
    - test back-end CRUD operations (graphiql)  ✅
    - add like and comment ability  ✅
    - design the front-end (Adobe-XD)  ✅
    - finish coding the front-end
    - implement the portfolio section

## 3- Finish development

    * add the navigation component and test routing
    * implement the PWA specs
    * styling final touch
    * measure performance (lighthouse) and optimize if needed

## 4- Build the app and serve it over (firebase hosting / netlify / heroku)

## 5- Buy custom .dev domain

## Notes

1. Make it fancy (react-particles) LATER
